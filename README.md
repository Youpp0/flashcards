# About
This is a simple flash card program made in C++. The original concept was to make a japanese alphabet program, but after 2 sets I decided to allow for custom decks rather than add kanji.


# Adding Custom Decks 
You will need to make two .txt files one that contains the questions/problems/words and the other containing the answers, and place them in the bank folder
They must match up in placement i.e. the answer to the first question listed must match the first answer listed. Putting them on seperate lines helps when making these lists.
