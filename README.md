# About
This is a simple flash card program made in C++. The original concept was to make a japanese alphabet program, but after 2 sets I decided to allow for custom decks rather than add kanji.


# Adding Custom Decks 
You will need to make 2 .txt files one that contains the questions/problems/words and the other containing the answers, and place them in the bank folder
They must match up in placement i.e. the answer to question 1 must be answer 1. Putting them on seperate lines helps when making these lists.
Make sure to include the extension when inputting file name.
